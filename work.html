            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>To create a complex, high-caliber 3D animated marketing video that was show-floor ready for CES, from creative to delivery, in 6 weeks. </p>
            </div>
            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The team moved quickly to assess the needs of Samsung’s Semiconductor, U.S. Division - to make their products, which power the things we as consumers know, alive and important to the end user. Our creative team produced a pitch to the client, complete with boards, within the first week.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The result was “Samsung @ the heart of everything”, an animated, multi-layered exploration into the inner workings of a suite of electronics, data servers, and smart autos, and how what’s inside serves us all on a daily basis.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>“Samsung @ the heart of everything” debuted at CES 2018, just 4 weeks after concept approval, to public and inter-divisional acclaim. Samsung Corporate asked that the video be put on permanent display on the large format lobby video wall at DSA Flagship HQ, in San Jose, California. Transparent House is currently enhancing the video to include more use case scenarios, graphics performance call-outs, and resolution improvements to enable play at up to 16K UHD.</p>

            </div>
            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The FAA passed a new regulation that allows non-pilots to earn their Light Sport Aircraft (LSA) license in as little as two weeks. To capitalize on these changes in regulation, ICON Aircraft engineered a revolutionary recreational aircraft.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The challenge was to brand, and bring to market, the ICON brand and its first aircraft, the A5 Amphibian, in a way that would appeal to two very different target audiences: seasoned pilots and potential new pilots.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The response was to create a brand identity system that was solid and credible enough for pilots, yet sleek and stylish enough for newcomers to the category. The logo adopted a propeller form, symbolizing “air, water and sea,” speaking to the amphibious nature of the plane. The shield element reinforced the brand’s integrity and commitment to safety. Colors and typography were developed with a nod toward strength and high-performance sport.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>We applied this brand identity system to ICON Aircraft’s corporate and consumer communications, as well as to both the exterior and interior of the A5 aircraft. We extended the brand identity system to the development of the new ICON Aircraft website. The site is a stylish and clean web experience that supports content ranging from hi-res imagery to product specifications. The website was built with a flexible and extensible content management system to allow for scalability.</p>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>To say that Rome is a unique city is quite an understatement. Its incredibly rich cultural heritage goes without saying. But the city is also very modern and forward thinking, and surprisingly livable.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>The City of Rome council asked us to develop a cohesive brand strategy and a new identity system to reflect the city's modern values and to capture the pride of its people, which meant refreshing an identity created by mankind - one dating back more than 2000 years ago, when the Roman empire established the colors, the heraldry and the acronym, the SPQR (Senatus Populusque Quiritium Romanus latin: the Senate and the People of Rome) on every touch point.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>At the heart of the new branding platform was a redesign of the SPQR crest, with the introduction of a 3D contemporary rendering, a custom designed typeface and a brighter color palette.  The new identity not only raised awareness and created a consistent look displayed throughout the city, but also succeeded in  underscoring Rome's role as an international hub for the arts, culture and business.</p>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Boost established itself early on as a youth brand offering primarily push-to-talk mobile phone service, but over time evolved into a fragmented brand with an “OR Complex”— speaking to either the “hip-hop” OR “surf” OR “skate” crowd. Additionally, the brand was subjected to the negative stigma of the prepaid segment renowned for noisy, indistinguishable, “out-pop” marketing tactics.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Boost realized that to grow their audience base they needed to elevate their brand idea and develop communications that reached beyond the niche groups and beyond the prepaid category. Our team worked with Boost to define a clear objective for the Boost brand. This was to be the phone for people who lived life without limits. This brand would be for young people who were NOT tied down by previous generations’ rules, looked at life optimistically and were open to expressing themselves via hip-hop, skating, surfing, or whatever they chose. </p>
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>We developed an evolved visual system elastic enough to drive every Boost touch point. The new system included retooled 2D and 3D logos, updated photographic styles, a custom typographic library, new color schemes and a new end tag for broadcast pieces, as well as templates for print and environmental applications. Every execution was designed to support the brand’s irreverent tone and celebrates the individuality of Boost users without pigeonholing them into distinct lifestyle categories.</p>

            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>We were engaged to create the brand strategy, identity, and activation for Orion’s main brand and also its line of wearable technology products. The wearables needed to be positioned and communicated as fashionable to consumers, as well as be portrayed appropriately across each target audience segment.</p>
            </div>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>With different target audience per wearable, MUSE developed three different identities for each product – tying each product back to the master brand. With a shifting business model, it allowed for flexibility for the Orion master brand.</p>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>Hyatt Regency had launched a new logo in 2014, but it lacked a comprehensive and meaningful design system to be applied globally.
